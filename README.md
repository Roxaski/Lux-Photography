## Welcome to Lux Photography

Lux Photography was created as a passion project. I am a huge fan of photography, so i created this website as a means to be able to showcase a wide variety of photography styles, all thanks to wonderful photographers who share their works of art online. You can browse the gallery to see these quality images, and check out some talented artists while your browsing the site if you'd like.

## Feedback 

If anyone has any feedback i would greatly appreciate, as i'm currently learning web development and if anybody has any constructive notes for me to improve upon, that would be great! For anyone that checks it out i hope you enjoyed browsing it as much as i enjoyed building it.

## Image Credits
